# orbit_tutorial_felix
I'm trying to grasp Isaac Orbit. Here is just some envs I created to learn Orbit.

## 2024.03.02
Upload orbit_velocity_tracking_env_cfg file. 

## 2024.03.08
Upload orbit_velocity_tracking_env_cfg/run_env.py to enable visualization of created RL environment for debugging.

## 2024.03.27 
- Update the tutorial according to the latest code.
- Add a README.md file as the utterly detailed code walking-through (but unmature).
